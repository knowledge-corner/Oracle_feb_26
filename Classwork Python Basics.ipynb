    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 Ordered/Indexed Sequences\n",
    "- Ordered sequences maintain the order of elements and allow indexing.\n",
    "- All ordered sequences follow rules of generic sequences, but not all iterables are ordered sequences.\n",
    "- Examples: \n",

    "#### 🔹 Container Sequences\n",
